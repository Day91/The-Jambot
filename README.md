# The Jambot
The Jambot is a fun, interactive and easy to use discord bot created by me, Jammy. There are many commands the bot is able to execute, from quick, useful commands such as purging to fun commands such as displaying anime (or no anime!).


Feel free to add it to your server at: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=742802810843693089&permissions=8&scope=bot

## Notes:
The prefix for the bot is `.`
The avaliable commands for a regular user are:

- anime
- noanime
- lyne
- ping
- github
- noleek
- scream
- pingpig
- nagrag
- invite

The available commands for anyone with Administrator perms are those listed above and:

- kick
- ban
- byebye( acts as a purge)

e.g. the command `.byebye 2`, when used by a server admin, will purge the most recent two messages.
